## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

I typed `$ nc 1337bank.money 1337` and that gave me the prompt to type in the relevant IP address. After that I knew because of googling command line injections, I had to type a command in order to get into the flag, so I first tried 1337bank.money; ls; which is supposed to show all the contents of the files. With the contents of all the files, it showed a directory of home. After that, I knew the flag probably was going to be a .txt file and people normally put files in the home directory, so I did 1337bank.money; find /home/ -name "*.txt"; Then it printed out all the txt files and where it's located in. I then did 1337bank.money; cat \home\flag.txt; which printed out the contents of the flag which was CMSC389R - {dlgging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion};

For fred to try to prevent this vulnerability is to validate untrusted inputs such as character set, date bounds, match to a regular expression pattern, and escape the patterns ( ) < > & * ‘ | = ? ; [ ] ^ ~ ! . ” % @ / \ : + , ` to prevent people from putting invalid commands. 

### Part 2 (60 pts)

In this code, the program does is a simple shell code that exploits the vulnerability of the program. What it does is it allows you to go into the servers port that are vulnerable and executes the command you type in. The first one is shell. When you type in shell, it asks you to type in commands afterwards. The commands you type in executes the commands onto the remote server by going logging into the ports and executing the command. The pull command pulls down files from the path that you tell it to and then downloads them into your current path. The help command prints out help for the program that tells you all the commands you can do in the program.
