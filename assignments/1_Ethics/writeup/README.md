### Part 2 (75 pts)

You should tell your boss that the company has a major security problem. The reason is because if you tell your consumer or the public about the issues of the security company, it maybe exploited and it could cause the company to lose thousands of dollars and that could potentially leave you unemployed which is against your interests. If the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU’s release then you should ask to see if they can patch the security problem on the next release. The reason is because if you go public with the security problem, it will most likely be exploited and that will certainly damage the car and endanger its occupants. Currently the security problem isn’t an issue unless it’s known publicly and exploited and actually causes harm to people. Now, if they decide to not patch the security problem at all after you ask them to fix it, then you should go fully public about the problem. The reason is because if they decide to not fix the problem that could potentially harm others, it is unethical for them because it hurts the consumers. if you if you do nothing you are responsible for the harm of the results. The reason is because you have a choice of telling others about the security problem and could have prevented it but you chose not to by being a bystander. Generally, if you see someone who is dying on the street and you decide not to help them, it is still your fault if they ended up dying because you could have prevented it by telling others.
