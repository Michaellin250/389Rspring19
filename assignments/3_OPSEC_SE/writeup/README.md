## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)


To social engineer this information out of Elizabeth Moffet, I would call her cell phone using a fake caller ID of ATM bank and say that something went wrong with her bank account and that I work for ATM bank and I need information to access it. I'll even provide a badge number or ID and say my name is one of the employees at the bank. To get the badge number, I would need to follow her and see what bank she normally goes to and what person she normally talks to on the counter and I'll impersonate that person. I would ask her first what is her ATM pin number because I need the pin number in order to access her bank account. If she asks me why, I'll say that in order to access her ATM account, I need to know her pin number. Once she gives me her pin number I'll say that her account has a few security questions that stops me from seeing her account. I'll ask her what is her first pet is, followed by the city she's born in and then her mother's maiden name. If she says that she didn't have security passwords, I'll say that she should have security questions to verify that her information is actually correct, and that I'm there to set up security questions for her. After I ask her these questions, I need to ask her to login to her bank account online at home in order to make sure nothing is wrong with it. When she logs into her account, I'll ask her what browser she uses. If she asks why I'll say that sometimes information gets leaked on the browser and sometimes some browsers don't work to access your bank account. Once all that is done, I'll say that her account is fine and she should have a nice day.


### Part 2 (60 pts)

There were a few vulnerabilities that I had identified. One is exposed ports. The exposed ports were 22, 80, and 1337. What she should do is to close those open ports and prevent people from actually getting into her website instead of having open ports. She should also change her password. Her password was linkinpark which is one of the most common passwords. What she should do is have a very long password and use different types of combinations to prevent people from being able to crack it. Based on https://crambler.com/password-security-why-secure-passwords-need-length-over-complexity/, longer passwords need longer time to crack. Another thing she should change was her username. Instead of using v0idcache which is able to be identified using OSINT, she should use a longer username that is tougher to find or crack and use a number of combinations for characters for her username.
